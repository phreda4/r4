 i guess it depends but ... probably ... a word for binding the current tileset , so like 
!TILESET, words for getting the tile width/height from the current tileset,
TILEW / TILEH , 
bind tilemap !TILEMAP , 
fetch and decode a tile entry from a tilemap , or maybe it's just an index ... store that (index, flip, palette, attribute) to global variables so it can be modular ...
@TILE ( x y -- ) then INDEX> FLIP> etc ...
draw the map with a word like ... TILEMAP, ha.
