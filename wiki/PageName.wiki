Here's a super quick intro to using the system

= Details =

The steps are :

  # unzip the distribution in a directory
  # run r4.exe in that directory :)

That's it, a window should open with a running system.

You can change the resolution :r4 runs in by using some command line parameters :

r4.exe wWIDTH hHEIGHT

where *WIDTH* and *HEIGHT* are the resolution you want. Say for example you want to run in 900x600, you'd execute :

r4.exe w900 h600

the next (small) hurdle would be the keyboard. You need to edit the reda4.txt file in the main distribution directory, the top of it looks like this :
{{{
| Teclado, Memoria, Conversion, Basicos
| PHREDA
| :r4 system library
|-------------------------
^key-es1.txt	| Distribucion de teclado - Scancode to Ascii
}}}

Three keyboards are taken into account : Spanish, US and French.

If your keyboard is US, you want to have `^`key-us1.txt instead of `^`key-es1.txt

If your keyboard is French, you need `^`key-fr1.txt instead of `^`key-es1.txt
