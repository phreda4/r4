#summary Android version of the virtual machine.

A first version of the Android virtual machine was distributed in February 2013. This page documents what is different and what is specific to this version of :r4.

Systems on which :r4 has been tested : Cynus T1 phone, Nexus 7 tablet. We are confident the system should work on most hardware. Please do inform us if you have an issue with your hardware.

Note that as of March 2013, not all programs work in the Android version, mostly due to the lack of keyboard. Solutions are in the work.

For an example of working program, run "memoria". First, click on the "games" carpet in the Home screen, then on the "memoria" icon. "memoria" is "memory" in Spanish, it is a memory game. It also shows advanced 2d graphics and font management.

For any program, a first click on the icon selects the program, the second click runs the program. To view the code ( *all* the code is available), click a first time to select the program, then on the icon at the bottom of the screen that looks like a pencil. This opens a text editor that is usable from an Android phone, which of course is also written in :r4.
