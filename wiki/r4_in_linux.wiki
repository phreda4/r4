How to run :r4 in Linux

= Introduction =

The executables in the distribution ( r4.exe, r4gl.exe) are compiled for the windows environment. They won't work directly in Linux.

= Details =

All that's needed is _*Wine*_ (http://www.winehq.org/). Thanks to that great project you can run windows executables in the linux operating system.

In ubuntu, you'd run *sudo apt-get install wine* to have the package installed.

Once Wine is installed, just go to the directory in which :r4 was installed and type in :

*wine r4.exe*

to have the system run in the default resolution.

Otherwise, all command line parameters are available, amongst which :

*wine r4.exe w1280 h800*

which opens the system in a 1280X800 resolution.

It's really that simple, audio works fine too !
