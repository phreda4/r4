#summary Super Quick Intro

Here's a super quick intro to using the system

= Details =

The steps are :

  # unzip the distribution in a directory
  # run r4.exe in that directory :)

That's it, a window should open with a running system.

You can change the resolution :r4 runs in by using some command line parameters :

{{{
r4.exe wWIDTH hHEIGHT
}}}

where *WIDTH* and *HEIGHT* are the resolution you want. Say for example you want to run in 900x600, you'd execute :

{{{
r4.exe w900 h600
}}}

here are other switches :

  * `f`  for fullscreen
  * `cNAMEFILE` to load, compile and run NAMEFILE
  * `iNAMEIMA` to save an IMG file with the BYTECODES
  * `xNAMEIMA` to load and run a IMG file
  * `s` for silent mode (compile only)

the next (small) hurdle would be the keyboard. You need to edit the reda4.txt file in the main distribution directory, the top of it looks like this :
{{{
| Teclado, Memoria, Conversion, Basicos
| PHREDA
| :r4 system library
|-------------------------
^key-es1.txt	| Distribucion de teclado - Scancode to Ascii
}}}

Three keyboards are taken into account : Spanish, US and French.

If your keyboard is US, you want to have `^`key-us1.txt instead of `^`key-es1.txt

If your keyboard is French, you need `^`key-fr1.txt instead of `^`key-es1.txt

= But I want the very latest code !! =

Well, then you need to checkout the code with subversion as explained here : http://code.google.com/p/reda4/source/checkout

You need to have subversion installed on your box, in ubuntu it's :

sudo apt-get install subversion

then once subversion is installed, type in :

svn checkout http://reda4.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ reda4-read-only

in the ./reda4-read-only directory that's created by the subversion command line above you'll find the very last code.
