#summary This page documents the r4 bytecode.

= Introduction =

The purpose of this page is to document the bytecodes generated by the r4 bytecode compiler ( note that there is also an ASM compiler).

= Details =

Some r4 words are translated directly into a bytecode, the character + for example, becomes SUMA, or $2d in a simple one to one process.

Other words, or group of words are more complex to compile.

This sequence for example :       {{{1 0? ( 2 ) 3}}}

becomes :
{{{
   20426ff4 : 95             | 01 
   20426ff5 : 07 01          | IF 2
   20426ff7 : 96             | 02 
   20426ff8 : 97             | 03 
}}}

Or this sequence :   {{{1 [ 2 ] 3}}}

which becomes :
{{{
   20426ffa : 95             | 01 
   20426ffb : 01 02 70 42 20 | LIT 20427002
   20427000 : 05 01          | JMPR 2
   20427002 : 96             | 02 
   20427003 : 97             | 03 
   20427004 : 00             | FIN
}}}

To generate bytecode for "test.txt" :

wine r4.exe ctest.txt icp.r4x s

To see the a de-compilation :

java R4_decompilador cp.r4x

R4_decompilador is located in ./MV/r4java
