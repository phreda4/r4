#How to compile the executable

= Introduction =

The system is built with Dev-Cpp which is Mingw based.

A single other piece is necessary : the FMOD library.

= Details =

Dev-Cpp can be installed from this source : 

http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html

This process has been tested with Version 4.9.9.2 which is available in oct. 2010

Once the system is installed, the FMOD package can then be installed from Dev-Cpp as
follows :

 * Tools -> Check for Updates/Packages...
 * Choose the devpaks.org server
 * FMOD-3.72 should be listed
 * Install the package

At this points, Execute -> Compile & Run should build the executable.
