Dev-Cpp can be installed from this source ( This process has been tested with Version 4.9.9.2 ) :

Once the system is installed, the FMOD package can be installed from Dev-Cpp as
follows :

 * Tools -> Check for Updates/Packages...
 * Choose the devpaks.org server
 * Select FMOD-3.72
 * Install the package

At this points all the necessary elements are in place.

The r4 distribution can be downloaded from this site and unzipped.

To load the r4 project into Dev-Cpp, just open the r4wine.dev file, and then :

Execute -> Compile & Run should build the executable.
